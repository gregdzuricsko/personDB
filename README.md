# Learning the Flux architecture
Starting with the boilerplate at http://github.com/justinrassier/gulp-browserify-react-boilerplate, this was an attempt to understand the Flux architecture without dependeing on everything that Facebook has to start out with.



```ShellSession
npm install -g gulp
npm install
```

## For building


```ShellSession
gulp

```
Default gulp will lint the source, run browserify with a react transform for JSX compilation then perform a watch on source.
